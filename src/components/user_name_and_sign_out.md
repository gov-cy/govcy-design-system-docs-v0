Use this component to help the user’s identify which account they are signed in withand provide them with a link to sign out of their account.

*Example*
<div class="govcy-container govcy-p-4  govcy-br-1 govcy-br-standard govcy-mb-4">
<div class="govcy-container">
    <div class="govcy-text-end"> User’s Name | 
        <a href="#" class="govcy-sign-out">Sign Out</a>
    </div>
</div>  
</div>  

*Sample HTML Code*

```html
<div class="govcy-container">
    <div class="govcy-text-end"> User’s Name | 
        <a href="#" class="govcy-sign-out">Sign Out</a>
    </div>
</div>      
```

The `User’s name` in this component should contain the name (not the username) of the signed in Ariadni profile account.

## When to use this component
Always include this component when the user is signed in with an Ariadni account.

## When not to use this component
Never use the component when the user is not signed in. 

## How it works

Always place the user’s name and sign out component at the top of a page, in the [Before Main](../../styles/page_templates) (`<section id="before-main">`) element. The component should be the first component to appear after the header and should be aligned to the left of the page as shown in the example below. You can use the `govcy-text-end` class to align the component on the left.

Make sure to implement the sign out mechanism according to Ariadni’s standards when the user clicks the `sign out` link.
